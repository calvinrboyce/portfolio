# Welcome to my Portfolio

    "The hard part about math isn't knowing if you're right or wrong, it's knowing if anybody cares"

That was Travis Oliphant, creator of **numpy** and **Anaconda, Inc.** at the 10 year ACME anniversary last fall

The Applied Computational Mathematics Emphasis at Brigham Young University covers the foundational mathematics behind just about every computational tool we have, from audio engineering to commercial autopilot on airplanes

We won the American Mathematical Society's Exemplary Program award for 2024, the #1 program in the nation this year

But not many people know who we are...

...yet.

If you'll indulge me, I'd love to explain to you why you should care about the math that we do, because odds are you're already using it every day, you just don't know it

In the ACME Labs folder you'll find a series of notebooks, the projects I've done twice a week for the last two years.
From facial recognition, to Google's PageRank algorithm, to solving Wordle, hopefully you find some of it relevant and see what it is that the ACME program is training us to do

_The projects and datasets were provided by and made possible by the BYU ACME program and materials can be found [here](https://acme.byu.edu/textbooks-and-lab-materials)_
